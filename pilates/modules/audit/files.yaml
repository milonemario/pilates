# Provide information on each tables.
# The index is particularly important as it specifies the sorting of the table
# It has to match (columns and order) an existing index to provide maximum
# performances. For this reason, we use schemas with actual tables instead
# of views.
# When no index exists on a table, use a combination of columns that appear
# to be as close as possible to a primary key. Note that the index if there is
# one does not need to be on a primary key (WRDS tables usually do not have
# primary keys).
